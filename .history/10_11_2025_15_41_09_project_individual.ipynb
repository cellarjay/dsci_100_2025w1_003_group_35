    "The broad question I aim to address is, \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\". This question will be addressed through a specific focus on players' age, where I will be trying to answer my specific question of, \"Can the ages of minecraft players be used to predict their subscription rates to gaming newsletters in the players dataset?\". I believe this can be achieved through grouping players into subsections of each experience level, then using the ages as a predictor to predict subscription to newsletters using a knn and linear regression model on a training set, then using rmspe summary statistics of both models to determine which one is better optimized in predicting, which will then be applied to the testing set.\n",

    "#### **Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following histogram is used to better understand the correlation between age and newsletter subscriptions. There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between the two variables when observing the graph, which may suggest age may not be a good variable to predict subscription, opposing my question. "
