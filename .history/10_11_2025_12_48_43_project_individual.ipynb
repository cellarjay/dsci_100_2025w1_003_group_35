    "Clearly state one broad question that you will address, and the specific question that you have formulated. Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question. One common question format is: “Can [explanatory variable(s)] predict [response variable] in [dataset]?”, but you are free to format your question as you choose so long as it is clear. Describe clearly how the data will help you address the question of interest. You may need to describe how you plan to wrangle your data to get it into a form where you can apply one of the predictive methods from this class.\n",

    "The broad question I aim to address in this project is, \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\". This question will be addressed through my specific focus on the ages of players, where I will be trying to answer my specific question of, \"Can the ages of minecraft players be used to predict their subscription rates to gaming newsletters in the players dataset?\". I believe this can be achieved through grouping players into subsections of each experience level, then using the ages as a predictor to predict subscription to newsletters using a knn and linear regression model, then using rmspe summary statistics of both models to determine which one is better optimized in predicting. \n",
